= Server General Logic =

Here is how it works.

  * It is known that the only way to modify the gamestate is through 'actions'.
  * The server receives an action from HTTP. In order to identify the context of the action, each action ships with a respective Game ID (can be omitted when the action is not specific-game related) and User ID (mandatory).
  * The server parses, validates and dispatches the action to the corresponding logic, mapping it to a class member function and passing it any extra parameters that were given through the request.
  * The action-mapped function gets called by the dispatcher, returning a value of whether or not the action went smoothly.
  * The dispatcher logs the action along with its resulting status and gives the action result back to the requester.

This model allows extensibility to cover any other turn-based game. It is apparent that there is no Monopoly-specific point anywhere in the list.
